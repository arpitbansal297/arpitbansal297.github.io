I am a [PhD Candidate](https://www.cs.umd.edu/people/bansal01) at the University of Maryland, College Park advised by [Professor Tom Goldstein](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~tomg/). My research primarily revolves around empirical analysis and optimization of Deep Neural Network architectures, focusing on enhancing their training and inference mechanisms. I have a pronounced interest in image synthesis, specifically in text-to-image generation models, involving methodologies to streamline image generation processes and an in-depth exploration of diffusion model mechanisms. Additionally, with the aim to build neural networks that can do logical extrapolation and learn problem-solving skills, I have built neural-networks that can learn algorithms and thus extrapolate from easy-to-hard tasks using recurrence. A complementary aspect of my research includes investigating the inherent behaviors and characteristics of neural networks in various scenarios. Prior to UMD, I worked as a software developer with [Visa](https://usa.visa.com/) in Data Product Development divison and received my Bachelors and Masters (Dual Degree) from IIT Kharagpur in Electrical Engineering. My CV is available [here](https://arpitbansal297.github.io/assets/pdf/CV.pdf).

Along with research, I enjoy playing keyboard, and hiking.
