I am a [PhD Student](https://www.cs.umd.edu/people/bansal01) at the University of Maryland, College Park advised by [Professor Tom Goldstein](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~tomg/). My broad research interest lies in improving the understanding of Deep Neural Networks empirically and hence improving its training and inference. My research work ranges from algorithmic synthesis with neural networks to watermarking neural networks to investigating neural network's behaviors. Currently, I am understanding the mechanisms behind the working of diffusion models and thus improving them for different AI generation tasks. Prior to UMD, I worked as a software developer with [Visa](https://usa.visa.com/) in Data Product Development divison and received my Bachelors and Masters (Dual Degree) from IIT Kharagpur in Electrical Engineering. My CV is available [here](https://arpitbansal297.github.io/assets/pdf/CV.pdf).

Along with research, I enjoy playing keyboard, hiking, swimming and running.
