I am currently a second year [PhD Student](https://www.cs.umd.edu/people/bansal01) at the University of Maryland, College Park advised by [Professor Tom Goldstein](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~tomg/). My broad research interest lies in understanding and improving the way Deep Neural Networks train and perform inference. My research work ranges from making neural networks to extrapolate their knowledge to solve harder problems with more time to watermarking neural networks to understanding neural networks behaviors. Currently I am working on understanding diffusion models and adopting them to solve different AI tasks. Prior to UMD, I worked as a software developer with [Visa](https://usa.visa.com/) in Data Product Development divison and received my Bachelors and Masters (Dual Degree) from IIT Kharagpur in Electrical Engineering.

Along with research, I enjoy playing keyboard, hiking, swimming and running.
